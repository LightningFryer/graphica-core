			Fast food chains often use red and yellow in their branding, a deliberate strategy rooted in
			psychology, culture, and design. Red is dynamic and stimulating, grabbing attention,
			increasing heart rate, and triggering hunger. It conveys urgency, making it ideal for
			encouraging quick decisions in a fast-paced industry. Yellow complements red by evoking
			happiness, warmth, and optimism, creating a welcoming atmosphere that appeals to families and
			individuals alike.

			Together, red and yellow form a powerful combination: red sparks excitement and appetite,
			while yellow fosters comfort and positivity. Their high contrast ensures visibility and
			memorability, even from a distance or in low light. Culturally, these colors symbolize joy and
			celebration, making them universally appealing and ideal for global brands.

			Practical design advantages further enhance their effectiveness. Red and yellow are highly
			visible, even in challenging conditions, and their boldness makes logos memorable. Iconic
			brands like McDonaldâ€™s, Burger King, and KFC have mastered this combination to create lasting
			impressions, proving how thoughtful design can drive success. The strategic use of these
			colors not only captures attention but also reinforces the fast food industry's values of
			speed, affordability, and mass appeal.
