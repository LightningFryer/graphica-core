			You've probably had that popular soft drink with a blue label made by Coca-Cola, right? Yes,
			I'm talking about "Thums Up." Some of you might think I spelled it wrong—don't worry, I used
			to think it was "Thumbs Up" too, until I saw the label. Pretty shocking, right? Now, picture
			the Monopoly Man. Is he holding a monocle? Many of us are confident that he is, but the actual
			Monopoly Man doesn't have one. Here's another one: remember how the Pokémon "Pikachu" looks?
			Well, its tail doesn’t have a black tip. For me, this was a "my whole life was a lie" moment.

			After a bit of googling, I discovered the Mandela Effect. While Pikachu's tail might not be a
			big deal, imagine people thinking someone who is alive is actually dead. Sounds crazy, right?
			Yet, many people remember Nelson Mandela's death as occurring in the 1980s, not in 2013. This
			is why it's called the Mandela Effect.

			Another fun example is "Uncle Chipps" vs. "Uncle Chips." Many people remember the popular
			snack brand as "Uncle Chips," but it's actually "Uncle Chipps."

			One theory suggests that confabulation might be responsible for these false memories.
			Confabulation occurs when our brains fill in gaps in our memory with made-up, distorted, or
			misunderstood information. For instance, we might mix up similar visuals or combine elements
			from different sources, creating a new but incorrect memory. The power of suggestion and
			social reinforcement can make these inaccuracies stronger. When many people share the same
			false memory, it becomes widely accepted as true, further reinforcing the incorrect
			perception.

			Exploring the Visual Mandela Effect helps us understand how changeable our memories are and
			how open we are to shared false beliefs. It reminds us to carefully examine our memories,
			question their accuracy, and stay open to the possibility that what we "see" might not always
			be what truly is. The Mandela Effect shows us that our brains, while powerful, are not
			perfect, and that our collective memories are often as fascinating as they are flawed. But
			what if there’s more to it than just false memories?
