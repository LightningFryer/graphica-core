	<div class=" w-[60%] place-items-center space-y-10">
		<h2 class="w-full text-center font-bebas text-6xl">Society 27</h2>
		<img src={Society27} alt="society_27" />
		<p class="text-justify font-poppins text-xl">
			The Society 27 logo by Pavel Pavlov makes use of the fantastic ambigram effect, which ensures
			the logo display exactly the same when viewed in an upside down position. The abstract use of
			the quotation marks and number seven cleverly make up the complete 27.
		</p>

		<h2 class="w-full text-center font-bebas text-6xl">Metroplex</h2>
		<img src={Metroplex} alt="metroplex" />
		<p class="text-justify font-poppins text-xl">
			The Metroplex logo by Brand Berry creates an excellent sense of depth with the use of
			three-dimensional shapes. The array of cuboid shapes represents skyscraper buildings which
			make up the overall metropolis graphic, linking well to the meaning behind the name.
		</p>

		<h2 class="w-full text-center font-bebas text-6xl">Schizophrenic</h2>
		<img src={Schizophrenic} alt="society_27" />
		<p class="text-justify font-poppins text-xl">
			Another logo that plays in representational symbols while relating heavily to the brand name
			is the Schizophrenic logo. Being a medical disorder that often depicts split personalities the
			logo characterises this with simple shapes that depict a happy and sad face.
		</p>

		<h2 class="w-full text-center font-bebas text-6xl">Modern Nerd</h2>
		<img src={ModernNerd} alt="society_27" />
		<p class="text-justify font-poppins text-xl">
			The Modern Nerd logo makes fine use of negative space to fool the eye into seeing the overall
			image of a figure, using just the symbolic shapes of hair, glasses and tie it links in well to
			the stereotypical geek/nerd image.
		</p>

		<h2 class="w-full text-center font-bebas text-6xl">Olympic Logo of London 2012</h2>
		<img src={Olympics} alt="society_27" class="size-64" />
		<p class="text-justify font-poppins text-xl">
			Designed by Wolff Olin’s at an expenditure of Â£400,000 (almost $800,000), the logo has been
			met with expected ambivalence and, in some unavoidable cases, hatred. It is perhaps the worst
			logo for the Olympics to date.
		</p>

		<h2 class="w-full text-center font-bebas text-6xl">GAP – A lesson in unnecessary changes</h2>
		<img src={Olympics} alt="society_27" class="size-64" />
		<p class="text-justify font-poppins text-xl">
