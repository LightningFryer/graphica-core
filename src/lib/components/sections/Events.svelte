			As a design club, we immerse ourselves in the vibrant world of creativity and innovation. We
			focus on design not just as a discipline, but as a way of thinking that shapes the spaces,
			products, and experiences around us. Our scope of work includes graphic design, web
			development, animation, and 3D modelling, allowing us to tackle a diverse range of projects
			that challenge conventional ideas. Through collaborative workshops and hands-on challenges, we
			cultivate a supportive environment where every idea is valued.
